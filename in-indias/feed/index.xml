					<description><![CDATA[&#062; Mr. Modi has remained popular despite a weak economy and a bungled initial response to the coronavirus that left hundreds of thousands dead. He has increasingly relied on communal politics, continuing to consolidate a Hindu nationalist base he has worked for decades to rally.

&#062; But the mission to deliver water to every household combines two of Mr. Modiâ€™s political strengths: his grasp of the day-to-day problems of hundreds of millions of Indiaâ€™s poor and his penchant for ambitious solutions.

Main reason for posting this is the part i have commented. Calling all Indians who vote for Modi chaddi doesn&#039;t cut it. Need to understand them...

The flair is hilarious though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="ðŸ˜‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> that shit backfired, so I couldn&#039;t resist]]></description>
