					<description><![CDATA[From what I understand of him (though I don&#039;t feel he&#039;s worth much attention do don&#039;t know much) Peterson is Just a standard boring conservative. With that return to traditional values stuff it is easy to appeal to conservatives of all stripes.  

In fact this may be part of a wider lesson that the right is meant to be united as they all want a preservation/restoration of hierarchies which have, overwhelmingly the same socio-economic bases. The left, on the other hand must not seek unity as an end goal as there is no one point of reference for what we want to be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is amazing lmao. Just yesterday I had an argument with a friend (acquaintance) about Peterson who&#039;s a big fan and also an islamophobe.

					<description><![CDATA[Not surprising I guess when things like this happen:

Imagine if every Islamophobe converts to Islam either by guilt or by curiosity. Not gonna happen probably but crazy to think about. Heck I was a big islamophobe at one point and even I unironically considered converting to Islam in 2019.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For those intrested in this strange turn by Western Conservatives, read Submission by M. Houellebecq. 

He basically posits what many in the West are starting to think: Muslim immigrants coming into their countries have more in common with religious conservatives than the dominant secular liberals. In that book, conservatives in France start converting to Islam to fight liberal individualism.

&#038;#x200B;

Just goes to show how these people have been driven completely insane.

  
‚ÄúFor these Muslims, the real enemy‚Äîthe thing they fear and   
hate‚Äîisn‚Äôt Catholicism. It‚Äôs secularism. It‚Äôs laicism. It‚Äôs atheist   
materialism. They think of Catholics as fellow believers. Catholicism is  
 a religion of the Book. Catholics are one step away from converting to   
Islam‚Äîthat‚Äôs the true, original Muslim vision of Christianity.‚Äù]]></description>
